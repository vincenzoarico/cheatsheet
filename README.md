# Cheatsheet
A personal terminal cheatsheet also with the contribution of tealdeer and cheat.sh.

# Prerequisites

## Tealdeer
Advice for you is to enable auto-update local cache:
1. 'tldr --seed-config' to create a basic config.
2. 'tldr --show-paths' to show your config file path and activate the auto-update option using nano/vim.


# Preconfiguration
If you use bash, you must consider the .sh file inside the bash folder, and vice versa if you use zsh.

# Usage  
You can see the usage with the `cheatsheet help` command.

# Examples

# Notes 
Never execute `cheatsheet update` to update tealdeer if you didn't install it with Homebrew. You must consider a manual update of the tealdeer.
