# Cheatsheet
A personal terminal cheatsheet also with the contribution of tealdeer and cheat.sh.


# Prerequisites

   ## Tealdeer
   An advice for you is to enable auto-update local cache:
   
      1.`tldr --seed-config` to create a basic config.
      
      2.`tldr --show-paths` to show your config file path and activate the auto-update option using nano/vim.


# Preconfiguration
   You have to consider the .sh file inside the bash folder if you use bash viceversa if you use zsh.


# Usage  
   You can see the usage with the `cheatsheet help` command.


# Examples


# Notes 
   Never execute `cheatsheet update` to update tealdeer if you didn't install it with Homebrew. You must consider a manual update of tealdeer.
